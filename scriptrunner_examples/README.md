# ScriptRunner examples

## Summary

This example is about how to test javascript mapping scripts. Due to the fact, that Bosch IoT Things does not support
 on side debugging of your scripts so far, this is the proper way to check if the mapping script is valid. The 
 example makes use of the `ScriptRunner` class which wraps the mapping functionality into a class and makes it easy 
 to use. With this class it is possible to write unit tests for your scripts.
